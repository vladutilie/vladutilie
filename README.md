Hi there 👋, Vlad here.

I'm an engineer and I live in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

🏔 I like reading, hiking, travelling, preparing bbqs for my dear ones and since my 16s programming is one of my hobbies.

🔭 Currently I'm a collaborator at _@7code company_ where I'm working on projects with the following technologies: `WordPress`, `Laravel`, `NodeJS`, `NestJS`, `ReactJS`, `jQuery`, `SQL`, `Shell`, `JSON`, `AJAX`, `RESTful APIs`, `PHPUnit`, `Payment Gateways`.

🇷🇴 I'm a WordPress translator at [WP-Translations.PRO](https://wp-translations.pro) and General Translation Editor at [WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots).

👨🏼‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on projects on long term especially with `WordPress` or `NestJS`.

🌱 These pandemic days I'm learning some things about `JavaScript` from [javascript.info](https://javascript.info)

💬 Ask me anything about `WordPress`.

📫 You can reach me by email at `${hello} @ ${vladilie.ro}`.
