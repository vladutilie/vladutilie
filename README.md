#### Hi there 👋, Vlad here.

I'm a Software Engineer and I live in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.  
🏔 I like reading, hiking, traveling, preparing BBQs for my dear ones, and puzzles, and since my 16s programming is one of my hobbies.  
🔭 Currently I'm freelancing at _my own company_ where I work on projects mainly with (not in a specific order) `Node`, `Express`, `TypeScript`, `NextJS`, `ReactJS`, `NestJS`, `Neo4j`, `MongoDB`, `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `SQLite`, `WordPress` and `PHP`.  
❤️‍🔥 I like `NextJS` and `TailwindCSS` (below there are some projects built with these technologies) and use solutions like Supabase, Prisma, and Vercel very often.
I also have a released library ([euplatesc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/euplatesc)) on npmjs.org.

🇷🇴 I'm a WordPress translator at [WP-Translations.PRO](https://wp-translations.pro) and General Translation Editor at [WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots).  
👨🏼‍💻 I'm looking to collaborate on projects for the long term, especially with `JavaScript` technologies and/or `Neo4j`.

These days...  
💻 I'm learning some things about `Neo4j` and [`JavaScript`](https://javascript.info)  
📖 I'm reading "[The Intelligent Investor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106835.The_Intelligent_Investor)" by Benjamin Graham
 and a [few more](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/68128050?shelf=currently-reading).

💬 Ask me anything about `WordPress`.
