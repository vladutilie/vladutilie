#### Hi there 👋, Vlad here.

I'm an engineer and I live in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.  
🏔 I like reading, hiking, travelling, preparing bbqs for my dear ones and since my 16s programming is one of my hobbies.  
🔭 Currently I'm freelancing at _my own company_ where I work on projects mainly with `TypeScript`, `NextJS`, `NestJS`, `Neo4j`, `WordPress` and `PHP`.  

🇷🇴 I'm WordPress translator at [WP-Translations.PRO](https://wp-translations.pro) and General Translation Editor at [WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots).  
👨🏼‍💻 I'm looking to collaborate on projects for long term especially with `NestJS`, `Neo4j` or `WordPress`.

These days...  
💻 I'm learning some things about `JavaScript` on [javascript.info](https://javascript.info)  
📖 I'm reading [some Seneca's books]([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55855855-drag-inim](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23161695-alt-timp-nu-am-despre-scurtimea-vie-ii-despre-via-a-fericit)) and a [few more](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/68128050?shelf=currently-reading).

💬 Ask me anything about `WordPress`.
