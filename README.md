#### Hi there 👋, Vlad here.

I'm an engineer and I live in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.  
🏔 I like reading, hiking, travelling, preparing bbqs for my dear ones and since my 16s programming is one of my hobbies.  
🔭 Currently I'm a collaborator at _@7code company_ where I'm working on projects with the following technologies: `WordPress`, `Laravel`, `NodeJS`, `NestJS`, `ReactJS`, `jQuery`, `SQL`, `Shell`, `JSON`, `AJAX`, `RESTful APIs`, `PHPUnit`, `Payment Gateways`.  
🇷🇴 I'm WordPress translator at [WP-Translations.PRO](https://wp-translations.pro) and General Translation Editor at [WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots).  
👨🏼‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on projects for long term especially with `WordPress` or `NestJS`.

These pandemic days...  
💻 I'm learning some things about `JavaScript` on [javascript.info](https://javascript.info)  
📖 I'm reading [Dragă inimă](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55855855-drag-inim) by Vasi Rădulescu and a [few more books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/68128050?shelf=currently-reading).

💬 Ask me anything about `WordPress`.

📫 You can reach me by email at `${hello} @ ${vladilie.ro}`.
